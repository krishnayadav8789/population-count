        <h1>Government of India's Efforts to Address Population Growth</h1>
        <p>*The Government of India is taking a number of steps to address the challenges of population growth. <br> These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>*Investing in education and healthcare:</strong> The government is investing in education and healthcare to improve the lives of its citizens and reduce the birth rate.</li>
          <li><strong>*Providing family planning services:</strong> The government is providing family planning services to help couples space or limit their children.</li>
          <li><strong>*Promoting economic development:</strong> The government is promoting economic development to create jobs and improve the standard of living, which can help reduce the birth rate.</li>
          <li><strong>*Addressing environmental degradation:</strong> The government is addressing environmental degradation to reduce the impact of population growth on the environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just some of the steps that the Government of India is taking to address the challenges of population growth. It is a complex issue with no easy solutions, but the government is committed to finding ways to improve the lives of its citizens and protect the environment.</p>

        <p>According to the UN, the world’s 47 least developed countries are the fastest growing and will continue to experience rapid population growth between 2019 and 2050. <br> Nine out of the ten most climate vulnerable countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, which is expected to double in population by 2050—accounting for half the world’s population growth.</p>

     <div class="data1">
   
      <p>The UN’s medium variant projection shows that the global population will likely grow to 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 10.4 billion in the 2080s. <br> The fastest growth occurs among the 46 Least Developed Countries (LDCs). In these regions especially, rapid population growth exacerbates climate vulnerability and puts more people at risk.</p>
      
      <p>Nine out of the ten most climate vulnerable countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, which is expected to double in population by 2050—accounting for half the world’s population growth. <br> People in Somalia, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are among those facing frequent droughts, severe floods, extreme heat, and soil erosion, amidst rapidly growing populations.</p>
    </div> <hr>

    <div class="data2">
      <p>Currently, almost 1.8 billion people across 17 countries—a quarter of the world’s population—live in regions of extremely high water stress. Of these countries, 11 are located in the Middle East and North Africa, where annual average population growth of 1.7% is higher than the global average of 1.1%. Population pressures increase the threats posed by the decreasing availability of fresh water.</p>

      <p>There is currently a $5.3 billion funding gap for meeting family planning needs worldwide; yet, family planning programs receive less than one percent of international development aid. Increasing spending to fill the unmet need for family planning services will help address a variety of global challenges, ranging from development and human rights to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Healthy and educated populations are also better equipped to weather the effects of climate change.</p>

<p>Many of the world’s floodplains and coastlines are densely populated. Low-elevation coastal zones represent 2% of the world’s land area but contain well over 10% of the world’s population. Of the world’s 31 megacities (a city with a population above 10 million), 21 are along a coastline, and migration to the coasts is increasing. The World Resources Institute projects that the number of people affected by flooding will double between 2010 and 2030.</p>
